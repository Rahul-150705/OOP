# OOP

ðŸ“… Day 1 â†’ Class, Object & Constructors

Learn how to create classes and objects.

Understand instance variables and methods.

Implement constructors (default & parameterized).

âœ… Task: Create a Student class with id, name, and a constructor to initialize values.

ðŸ“… Day 2 â†’ Static Keyword

Learn about static variables, static methods, and static blocks.

Understand the difference between instance vs static members.

âœ… Task: Create a Counter class that tracks how many objects have been created using a static variable.

ðŸ“… Day 3 â†’ Inheritance & super()

Learn how one class can inherit from another.

Understand single inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

Use super() to call parent class constructors and methods.

âœ… Task: Create a Vehicle class â†’ extend it into Car and Bike. Use super() to initialize parent properties.

ðŸ“… Day 4 â†’ Polymorphism + Mini Project

Learn method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

Learn method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

Understand dynamic method dispatch.

âœ… Mini Project: Build a Vehicle Rental System where Car, Bike, and Truck calculate rental cost differently using polymorphism.

ðŸ“… Day 5 â†’ Abstraction & Encapsulation

Learn Encapsulation â†’ wrapping data (private fields + getters/setters).

Learn Abstraction â†’ hiding implementation, showing only essential features.

Understand difference:

Encapsulation = data hiding

Abstraction = implementation hiding

âœ… Task: Build a BankAccount class with private balance and public methods (deposit(), withdraw(), getBalance()) to demonstrate encapsulation & abstraction.
